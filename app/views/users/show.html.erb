<h2><%= @user.username %> </h2> has commented on the following posts:

<% @user.posts.each do |post| %>
  <%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %>
<% end %>
<!--we want our users to see a list of all of the posts that they've commented on. Because we've set up a join model, the interface will look almost identical. We can simply call the posts method on our user and iterate through.>
